1. Introduction
Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile DNA sequences that can move within a genome.
Many DNA transposons are flanked by short inverted repeats (IRs). In this project,
three NCBI genomes were scanned for short inverted repeats of length 4–6 nucleotides
without prior knowledge of their sequence. The goal was to identify possible
transposon-like regions marked by these IR pairs.

2. Data
The following FASTA genome files were analysed:

- C:\Users\Abd\Desktop\sdm\BioInformatics\lab8\acute.fasta (header: NC_045512.2 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, complete genome)
- C:\Users\Abd\Desktop\sdm\BioInformatics\lab8\Boebeisivirus.fasta (header: NC_130177.1 Boebeisivirus manatense isolate ctMfu914, complete genome)
- C:\Users\Abd\Desktop\sdm\BioInformatics\lab8\corona.fasta (header: NC_005831.2 Human Coronavirus NL63, complete genome)

3. Methods
Each genome was read from its FASTA file and all sequence lines were concatenated
into a single uppercase DNA string. For each motif length k in {4, 5, 6}, all k-mers
were indexed together with their positions. For each k-mer, its reverse complement
was computed and all pairs where the reverse complement appeared later in the
sequence were recorded as inverted repeat pairs. For each pair, the spacer length
between the two copies was computed. Results were visualised using scatter plots
of left IR start position vs spacer length.

4. Results
Summary statistics per genome are shown below:

Genome: NC_045512.2 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, complete genome

Genome: NC_005831.2 Human Coronavirus NL63, complete genome
File path: C:\Users\Abd\Desktop\sdm\BioInformatics\lab8\corona.fasta
Genome length: 27553 bp
Total inverted repeat pairs (length 4-6): 2697859
  Pairs with IR length 4: 2005938
  Pairs with IR length 5: 544036
  Pairs with IR length 6: 147885

From the scatter plots, inverted repeats can be seen distributed along the whole
length of each genome. Spacer lengths range from very small values (motifs almost
adjacent) up to large values when the second copy is far away from the first.

5. Discussion
Short inverted repeats of length 4–6 nucleotides are expected to occur frequently
by chance in long DNA sequences, so many of the detected pairs likely reflect the
background sequence composition rather than true transposon boundaries. However,
the method provides a useful first filter to highlight candidate regions for further
analysis. Regions where two IRs delineate a larger internal segment are especially
interesting as potential transposon-like elements.

6. Conclusion
A Python script was used to scan three genomes for short inverted repeats of length
4–6 nucleotides, report all inverted repeat pairs, and visualise their distribution.
The genomes contained many such pairs, widely distributed along their sequences.
Further biological analyses (for example ORF prediction or protein domain search)
would be needed to confirm which of these candidate regions correspond to real
transposable elements.
